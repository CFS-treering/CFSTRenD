\title{compare the median of tree ring measurement of a specific site to those of nearby sites}
\usage{
CFS_scale(
  target_site,
  ref_sites,
  scale.label_data_ref = "",
  scale.max_dist_km = 20,
  scale.N_nbs = 10
)
}
\arguments{
\item{target_site}{data.table with columns uid_site, site_id, species, longitude and latitude}

\item{ref_sites}{reference sites including species, uid_site, latitude, longitude, uid_radius, year, rw_mm in long format}

\item{scale.label_data_ref}{description of ref_sites}

\item{scale.max_dist_km}{maximum distance to search the neighbors in km}

\item{scale.N_nbs}{number of nearest-neighbors (maximum)}
}
\value{
A data table containing the median ring-width measurements of the involved sites, along with the distances from the specific site
}
\description{
Apply a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) method based on geographic location for the same species.
It compares the median tree-ring measurements of a specific site to those of nearby sites
