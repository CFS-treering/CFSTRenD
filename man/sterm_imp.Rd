\title{variable importance of smooth terms in a GAM model}
\usage{
sterm_imp(gam_model, method = c("ssq", "var", "meanabs"))
}
\arguments{
\item{gam_model}{A GAM model object.}

\item{method}{A character string specifying the method to compute importance.
One of \code{"ssq"}, \code{"var"}, or \code{"meanabs"}.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.table} with columns:
\describe{
  \item{var}{Name of the smooth term.}
  \item{importance_pct}{Relative importance as a percentage.}
  \item{method}{The method used for calculating the importance.}
}
}
\description{
Evaluates the relative influence of each smooth term in a GAM model by computing
its contribution to the fitted values using the linear predictor matrix
(\code{type = "lpmatrix"}). Three summary methods are available: sum of squares,
variance, and mean absolute value across all observations.
